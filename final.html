    <p>
        My final project for CSC106 is a game I coded, titled Asteroid Flight. It's an "endless runner" game, where your goal is simply to survive as long as possible, while trying to get as a high a score as possible. 
        To play the game, you use the arrow keys to move your ship around. You want to avoid the asteroids that come at you, while trying to pick up the yellow pellets that will increase your score. 
        There are three difficulties to choose from - Easy, Hard, and Extreme. Each difficulty is faster than the last, and it will be harder and harder to survive for longer amounts of time.
